# Blockchain-based-Cryptographic-Communication-System
Platform that develops a secure messaging solution using blockchain technology and cryptographic techniques, eliminating the need for trusted intermediaries and enhancing data security and integrity.

The blockchain is an innovative technology that overcomes these threats and allows decentralisation of sensitive operations while preserving a high level of security. It eliminates the need for trusted intermediaries. The blockchain is accessible to all network nodes and keeps track of all transactions already made. The goal of my work is to propose a secure messaging solution based on blockchain technology. In this project, I explained why blockchain would make communications more secure, and proposed a model design for blockchain-based messaging main- taining the performance and security of data recorded on the blockchain, using a smart contract to verify the identities and their associated public keys, and validate the users certificate. The system is entirely Combination of blockchain and cryptography for communication systems.

Introduction-
Blockchain is a peer-to-peer network; the word ‘blockchain‘ is made up of two separate terms, ‘block’ and ‘chain’. A block being referred to a collection of data, alias data records, and chain being referred to a public database of these blocks, stored as a list. 
These lists are linked using cryptography, making it the most essential and fundamental requirement for creating a blockchain. Blockchain is a growing list of records, and the blocks get appended to the list with time. Cryptography in blockchain can be a tricky concept, but we have tried to simplify it for your better understanding.  
Cryptography is a method of developing techniques and protocols to prevent a third party from accessing and gaining knowledge of the data from the private messages during a communication process. Cryptography is also made up of two ancient Greek terms, Kryptos and Graphein, the former meaning “hidden” and latter being “to write”. There are several terms related to cryptography, which are stated as follows: 
Encryption: It is a process of plaintext (normal text) to a ciphertext (random sequence of bits).
Decryption: The inverse process of encryption, conversion of ciphertext to plaintext.

Use of Cryptography in Blockchain:
Blockchains make use of two types of cryptographic algorithms, asymmetric-key algorithms, and hash functions. Hash functions are used to provide the functionality of a single view of blockchain to every participant. Blockchains generally use the SHA-256 hashing algorithm as their hash function.

Advantages: 
Our approach removes central authorities (CA) and uses the blockchain pub- lic as a distributed ledger of identity and their associated public keys. We use Blockchain to store public keys, digital signatures, and peer information.
Once published, the smart contract code works precisely as programmed. This is one of the main advantages of the platform, the code always interacts as promised, it cannot be falsified, and it never has any downtime. The system is trustworthy, transparent and traceable.
Confidentiality: Once the communication channel between users is se- cured, peer to peer encryption between endpoints can be set and only authorized users have access to the messages exchanged.
Message integrity and Authentication: The blockchain checks the validity of the signature, before being stored. Another person can not change/modify the signed agreement or alter exchanged messages during the network transit. Each user has a certificate stored on the blockchain. The smart contract checks the certificate and proves the identity of users. All exchanged messages are signed with private keys associated with the public key on certificates using the ECDSA algorithm.
Reliability: It is impossible to shut down all computers participating in the blockchain simultaneously. As a result, this database is always online, and its operation never stops.

I applied different algorithms for protection of our Communication system with later using Blockchain technology. It will further Increase the security to a higher level. 

USES: 
(1)This System will  help our Army, RAW, Police and Security Personals to use for Secure communication. 
(2)This System can also be deployed on a chatting system for the Encryption and Decryption process.

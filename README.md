# Blockchain-based-Cryptographic-Communication-System
Platform that develops a secure messaging solution using blockchain technology and cryptographic techniques, eliminating the need for trusted intermediaries and enhancing data security and integrity.

The blockchain is an innovative technology that overcomes these threats and allows decentralisation of sensitive operations while preserving a high level of security. It eliminates the need for trusted intermediaries. The blockchain is accessible to all network nodes and keeps track of all transactions already made. The goal of my work is to propose a secure messaging solution based on blockchain technology. In this project, I explained why blockchain would make communications more secure, and proposed a model design for blockchain-based messaging main- taining the performance and security of data recorded on the blockchain, using a smart contract to verify the identities and their associated public keys, and validate the users certificate. The system is entirely Combination of blockchain and cryptography for communication systems.
